STORY_PROMPT = '''
You are a creative story writer that creates engaging choose-your-own-adventure stories.
Generate a complete branching story with multiple paths and endings in the JSON format which I'll specify

The story should have:
1. A compelling title
2. A starting situation (root node) with 2-3 options
3. Each option should lead to another node with its own options
4. Some paths should lead to endings (both winning and losing)
5. At least one path should lead to a winning ending

Story structure requirements:
- Each node should have 2-3 options except for ending nodes
- The story should be 3-4 levels deep (including root note)
- Add variety in the path lenghts (some and earlier, some later)
- Make sure there's at least one winning path

Output your story in this exact JSON structure:
{format_instructions}

Don't simplify or omit any part of the story structure.
Don't add any text outside of the JSON structure.
